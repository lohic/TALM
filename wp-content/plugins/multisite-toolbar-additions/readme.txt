This plugin adds a few useful admin links to the WordPress Toolbar / Admin Bar in Multisite or Network installs.

== Description ==

> #### Quick Access to Super Admin Resources - Time Saver!
> This **small and lightweight** plugin just adds some missed and very useful admin links to your toolbar / admin bar in Multisite installs. Also included is support for some awesome, useful third-party plugins out of the box. So you might just switch from the backend or frontend of your site to the 'Network Wide Plugins' or access the 'Nav Menu' Settings of a sub site/blog. To make you even more happy, the plugin also works just perfectly in single WordPress installs (non-Multisite), just fewer menu items then... -- Use this time saver and get quicker access :-)

= General Features =

 * Only visible and accessable for Super Admins!

* *(Sub) Site specific stuff:*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `multisite-toolbar-additions` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory -- or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
2. In your Network Dashboard network activate the plugin through the (Network) 'Plugins' menu -- or in a sub site dashboard: per-site activate this plugin through the (Site) 'Plugins' menu
3. Look at your toolbar / admin bar within the "My Sites" menu and enjoy using the new links there :)
4. If you want you could add a special custom Nav Menu via "Design > Menus" (best if using the main site of your Network for that) and assign it to the new "Multisite Toolbar Menu" menu location (only visible & accessable for Super Admins!). [(See FAQ here for more instructions)](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-toolbar-additions/faq/)
4. Go and manage your Multisite Network :)

**Please note, this plugin requires WordPress 3.3 or higher in order to work!**

**Also note:** This plugin has NO settings page because I believe it's just not neccessarry. All customizing could be done via filters, constants and regular WordPress user roles & capabilities. As the plugin is only indended for a Super Admin (Network Admin) usage - that's the way to go. This way we can save the overhaul of an options panel/settings page, additional database requests, uninstall routines and such. End result: a lightweight system that just works and saves clicks & time :-).

**Multisite install:** Of course, it's fully compatible but have a look in the [FAQ section here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-toolbar-additions/faq/) for more info :)

**Single install:** The plugin also working like a charm - just without the network specific stuff. However, there's still A LOT (single) site specific stuff supported. So it's up to your use case :).

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/multisite-toolbar-additions/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `multisite-toolbar-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why another Multisite Toolbar plugin, there are already some others!? =
You're right! If you're happy with one of the others then that's absolutely great and you don't need to add or switch anything! :)
I just made this new plugin here for my own needs and some of my client admins. As I am an open source evangelist I like to release my stuff to give back to the community!

= Does this plugin work with latest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with the LATEST WordPress branch 3.4+! :-)
And sorry, it DOES NOT work with WordPress versions older than 3.3 so please update your install if you haven't done yet :).

= How do I use the custom Nav Menu for the toolbar? =
All menu items via a Custom Menu - and at all other places in the Toolbar (a.k.a. Admin Bar) - are only visible and accessable for Super Admins. That means in a Multisite environment all admins who can manage the network. In regular WordPress (single) installs these are users with the Administrator user role.

Added Menu Location by the plugin is: "Multisite Toolbar Menu" (again: only for Super Admins)

Steps for setting up a menu:

* Create a new menu, set a name like "Super Admin Toolbar" or such...
* Setup your links, might mostly be custom links, or any other...
* Save the new menu to the plugin's menu location. That's it :)
* *Please note:* Every parent item = one main toolbar entry! So best would be to only use one parent item and set all other items as children.

= How are new resources being added to the toolbar/admin bar? =
Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and I'll add the link if it is useful for Multisite/ Super Admins.

= Is this plugin Multisite compatible? =
Of course it is! :) Works really fine in Multisite invironment - for Super Admins.

= In Multisite, could I "network activate" this plugin? =
Yes, you could! Again, it's only displayed and useful for Super Admins. -- Activating on a per-site basis is also possible. Just decide what works best for you.

= Has this plugin any use for non-Multisite installs? =
Yes, of course! :) The plugin is *working like a charm* in single-site installs - just without the network specific stuff. However, there's still A LOT (single) site specific stuff supported. So it's up to your use case :).

= Special instructions for the supported 'BackWPup' plugin? =
Yes, I have some :) -- My plugin only adds any BackWPup resources to your toolbar if you didn't enabled the "Toolbar / Admin Bar option" on the BackWPup settings page.

* **Enable** BackWPup Toolbar / Adminbar = BackWPup handles its own stuff...
* **Disable** BackWPup Toolbar / Adminbar = Multisite Toolbar Additions will handle BackWPup's toolbar items :)

= Could certain sections/ item groups be removed? =
Yes, this is possible! You can remove the following sections: "My Sites" menu area (all network items) / "My Sites" menu area (all sub site specific items) / "Super Admin Nav Menu" group (all items) / "Network Plugin Support" (all network plugin items) / "(Sub Site) Plugin Support" (all site plugin items) / "(Sub) Site Specific Items" - useful to disable for specific Super Admin users...

To achieve this add one, some or all of the following constants to your main theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file, functionality plugin or MU plugin:
`
/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Remove Network Admin Specific Items */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_ITEMS', FALSE );

/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Remove Sub Site Specific Items */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_SUBSITE_ITEMS', FALSE );

/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Disable Custom Nav Menu for Super Admins */
define( 'MSTBA_SUPER_ADMIN_NAV_MENU', FALSE );

/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Disable Plugin Support for Network Wide Plugins */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_EXTEND_GROUP', FALSE );

/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Disable Plugin Support for (Sub) Site Specific Plugins */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_SITE_EXTEND_GROUP', FALSE );

/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Disable Site Specific Items */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_SITE_GROUP', FALSE );
`

= Could the the whole toolbar entries be removed, especially for certain users? =
Yes, that's also possible! This could be useful if your site has special user roles/capabilities or other settings that are beyond the default WordPress stuff etc. For example: if you want to disable the display of any "Multisite Toolbar Additions" items for all user roles of "Editor" please use this code:

To hide only from the user with a user ID of "2":
`
/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Remove Network Admin specific Items for user ID 2 */
if ( 2 == get_current_user_id() ) {
	define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_ITEMS', FALSE );
}
`

To hide items only in frontend use this code:
`
/** Multisite Toolbar Additions: Remove Network Admin specific Items from frontend */
if ( ! is_admin() ) {
	define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_ITEMS', FALSE );
}
`


**Final note:** I DON'T recommend to add customization code snippets to your main theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file! **Please use a functionality plugin or an MU-plugin instead!** This way you can also use this better for Multisite environments. In general you are then more independent from theme/child theme changes etc. If you don't know how to create such a plugin yourself just use one of my recommended 'Code Snippets' plugins.

== Additional Info ==
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** Just a little lightweight plugin for all the Multisite Super Admins out there to make their daily network admin life a bit easier. I'll try to add more plugin support if it makes some sense. So stay tuned :).
